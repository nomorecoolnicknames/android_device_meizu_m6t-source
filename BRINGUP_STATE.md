# Public source checkpoint — 2026-09-29

FACT: published source comes from `cdc0154f9870c177b6cb2ebc19bbbe0c06d5237c`; file identity and exclusions are recorded in `SOURCE_PROVENANCE.json`. Publication-only changes redact device identifiers, omit binary/private evidence inputs and add this status record. Original source repositories and dirty work are unchanged.

Validation: exported files are UTF-8 text with no NUL bytes; all identifier findings were removed or reviewed as generic source/configuration values. No build, flash or runtime test was performed for publication. No hardware-ready image is distributed here.

Next gate: pin the complete platform and separately supplied inputs, then run the matching Forge build recipe and verify its result before any hardware testing.
